                <h1>Information for Applicants</h1>
                <p>Having a guide dog has enriched the lives of thousands of people all over the world. However, approximately only 2% of the blind and visually impaired population utilizes a guide dog. While being a wonderful and safe option for travel, the realities of guide dog mobility are not as straightforward as you may think. Canadian Guide Dogs for the Blind encourages you to consider the following information carefully before applying. What follows is an explanation of what guide dog mobility entails, the training process, and who can apply for a guide dog.</p>

            <h1>Benefits of Guide Dog Mobility</h1>
            <p>ou have already expressed an interest in guide dog mobility and you probably have some positive ideas about this form of advanced mobility. The training staff of Canadian Guide Dogs for the Blind encourages you to seek out other guide dog users and discuss their experiences with them. They are bound to have plenty of praise for their guide dogs and the independence they have gained. They also may be able to recount some of the challenges they have faced as guide dog users.</p>
            <p>Guide dog mobility can offer relative ease of travel. The concept of travel is different from long cane travel as the purpose of the cane is to locate, identify and move around obstacles. A guide dog moves around all of those obstacles, causing travel to be smoother, less stressful and often faster. For these reasons, guide dog users tend to gain confidence and greater independence. If a guide dog user applies discipline, effort and patience within the first year, they will reap all the benefits of guide dog mobility including companionship, freedom and new social encounters. Many people are interested and curious about guide dogs, creating a conversation starter, and the opportunity to develop friendships. Caring for a healthy, well-behaved and well-groomed dog should also be a source of pride and give the guide dog user a sense of accomplishment as they embark on a positive and rewarding lifestyle choice.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>Eligibility and Application</h1>
            <p>You are eligible to apply to Canadian Guide Dogs for the Blind if you are registered as legally blind (many guide dog users have some useful vision); a permanent resident of Canada; and at least sixteen years old.</p>
            <p>You need a strong desire to improve your independence and mobility. Most people are surprised by the mental and emotional strain induced by the training process. A solid partnership can take up to a year to form, so a determined, positive attitude is necessary in order to succeed. You must be ready to put in the work to succeed.</p>
            <p>Many people find they do not work their guide dogs as often or as long in the winter months. If the team is less active during the winter or at certain times of the year, it is the responsibility of the guide dog user to manage the dogâ€™s weight and maintain good physical and mental conditioning. This means close monitoring and adjusting of food intake to meet the needs of the dog when the guide dog is not working as often. The dog must still get exercise and be walked on a daily basis in all weather conditions.</p>
            <p>You need enough financial resources to properly care for a guide dog. Inquiring about veterinarian discounts, government subsidies, and providing the dog with the necessary comforts such as a dog bed and toys are the financial responsibility of the guide dog user, and it is a good idea to investigate some aspects in advance of applying or training.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>The Challenges of Training</h1>
            <p>Training with a guide dog is about building a partnership. When the dog first meets the client, the dog does not know how significant this person is going to turn be in their life. Unfortunately, it cannot be explained to the dog. The dog gradually has to learn that this is the human being who is going to love and feed them. However, until he is convinced, the guide dog may challenge this new owner by ignoring the commands or misbehaving. The bonding can be a long and bumpy process. The role of the Guide Dog Mobility Instructor is to help make it smoother.</p>
            <p>Classes, which are 18 days long, take place at the National Training Centre of Canadian Guide Dogs for the Blind. A class of clients will include a maximum of eight clients from across Canada, with two Guide Dog Mobility Instructors. If there are four clients or fewer, the ratio drops to one Guide Dog Mobility Instructor. Clients work six days a week, and clients usually return home on the Friday of the third week.</p>
            <p>The first day of class involves travel to the National Training Centre, orientation to the residence, getting settled and comfortable in the environment, reviewing expectations for the training course, and a fire and evacuation drill. The second day is spent learning new skills to prepare the students for handling their guide dogs. Knowledge of basic dog handling is essential so the guide dog respects the new handler right away and is invested in bonding with this new person. Then, each client meets his/her new guide dog. From that point on, the client becomes responsible for the care and handling of the dog, under the supervision of the instructor. Every day, the new teams go on at least two training walks together, beginning in quiet residential areas with individual instruction. Towards the end of class, the guide dog team is ready to tackle busy city streets with less support from the instructor. These walks take place in all types of weather conditions, so clients need to come prepared with proper outdoor clothing. This is not the time to break in new shoes. As well, umbrellas will not be allowed, as guide dog training requires the use of both hands to control and work the dog. In their spare time, clients are occupied with lectures on dog psychology, grooming, feeding, relieving and playing with their dogs, winning their dogâ€™s affections and trust.</p>
            <div>
                <h1>Costs</h1>
                <p>Canadian Guide Dogs for the Blind provides all services free of charge, including transportation to and from our National Training Centre, the guide dog, the training course, and room and board. Canadian Guide Dogs for the Blind operates solely through donations, and fundraising efforts. The applicant pays only for costs associated with the application process, such as fees for doctorâ€™s reports. Upon graduation, the client signs a contract and pays one dollar for the guide dog. The contract and payment are a binding agreement for the client to lease the guide dog during itsâ€™ working life. Canadian Guide Dogs for the Blind retains ownership of the dog to protect both clients and dogs.</p>
                <p>Each client may want to bring spending money. There are social outings during training, such as coffee shops and restaurants, which are optional but strongly encouraged. This is an important part of the training process, as social environments present a different set of challenges. All residential meals are provided, but you may wish to have extra funds for snack foods, additional beverages, toiletries or other items you may require during your stay. Volunteers are able to shop for clients on a set schedule, for any basic needs.</p>
                <p>Once the guide dog user returns home, all the costs related to the dog become the responsibility of the guide dog user. Expenses include food, veterinary visits, and incidentals like toys or additional equipment such as dog boots.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h1>The Aftercare Program</h1>
                <p>Canadian Guide Dogs for the Blind provides itsâ€™ clients with assistance in maintaining the highest possible standards of mobility with their guide dogs. Immediate aftercare is a 1-3 day visit within a few days after graduation. It is designed to ensure the team gets off to a positive start, including the dog settling into the home, and introducing routes to the guide dog with the appropriate level of support. Two post-class aftercare visits are scheduled around 6-months and 18-months after training. These tend to be times when guide dog teams benefit the most from the advice and support of an instructor. Additional visits will occur thereafter approximately every twelve months. During an aftercare visit, a qualified instructor visits the team at a prearranged time, at home or at work. During a routine visit of 1-2 hours, the client and instructor will discuss the teamâ€™s progress, and then go for a walk to check on the safety and standard of the team. The instructor will provide advice and feedback to ensure every team works to the best of their abilities. The instructor will also check the guide dogâ€™s health and provide advice as needed. If a graduate is experiencing significant difficulties, Canadian Guide Dogs for the Blind may make a priority aftercare visit. This is at the discretion of the organization. Often times, a phone call with an instructor can aid a guide dog user by offering suggestions for how to work through a particular problem.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h1>Retirement of Guide Dogs</h1>
                <p>There is no set time for a guide dog to be retired. However, a guide dog must retire by itsâ€™ 11th birthday. The working life of the guide dog will depend largely on itsâ€™ physical and mental state.</p>
                <p>Canadian Guide Dogs for the Blind insists that our guide dogs do not continue working when age affects their physical or mental abilities. If a guide dog user wishes to retrain with another guide dog following retirement of the current dog, the organization will reassess that individual and begin looking for a suitable replacement. The goal is to have a seamless transition from the retiring guide dog to the replacement guide dog, preventing any interruption in guide dog mobility.</p>
                <p>Following retirement, the guide dog user and his/her immediate family may be able to keep the dog. The final decision is made by the organization on an individual basis. One factor is the retired dog cannot be left at home all day. If the retired dog will not remain with the client, Canadian Guide Dogs for the Blind will find a suitable and loving home for the dog. In some cases, we may offer the dog to itsâ€™ original puppy walker.</p>
