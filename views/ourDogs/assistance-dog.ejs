                <h3>What Can an Assistance Dog Do?</h3>

                <p>Some of the tasks an assistance dog can be trained to do are: picking up items accidentally dropped (such as keys, coins, bank cards, wallet, pens, papers, etc.); retrieve specific items by name (phone, leash, shoes, etc.); retrieve out of reach items with the aid of a laser pointer; retrieve items from another person bring to the handler, and vice-versa; assist with pulling off socks, zippers & sleeves; opening & closing doors & drawers; turning lowered light switches on & off; triggering the automatic access button on doors; triggering a house alarm and barking for help if the handler needs assistance.</p>

                <h3>Additional Considerations</h3>

                <p>Teaming up with an assistance dog requires a great deal of responsibility and effort to keep up with existing training and general care and well-being of the dog (i.e. food, veterinary expenses, etc.). You must be willing and ready to schedule and enter into a period of 2-4 weeks of intensive training with a dog upon being matched with an assistance dog. Assistance dogs are not for everybody. They require a great deal of commitment. They are highly trained, intelligent canines but they are still dogs. Assistance dogs need time, effort and attention on a daily basis to maintain the work standard they were trained to do.</p>
