                A volunteer is a person who believes that people can make a difference and is willing to prove it. Volunteers don’t work for money. They work for less tangible but equally important forms of remuneration such as satisfaction, appreciation and the opportunity to build skills, all while helping others. Canadian Guide Dogs for the Blind relies greatly on volunteers to add to the success of our organization. If you are interested in volunteering for Canadian Guide Dogs for the Blind, please complete our volunteer application and submit it by email, mail, or drop it off at our National Training Centre.

                <li class="volunteer-li">Our current volunteer opportunities are limited to what is shown on the volunteer application.</li>
                <li class="volunteer-li">When you submit a volunteer application, we will follow up with you when an opportunity arises in your area(s) of interest.</li>
                <li class="volunteer-li">Puppy Walking/Raising is the only hands-on opportunity with dogs. We do not offer other volunteer positions with dogs. Visit our Puppy Walking page for details on this opportunity.</li>
                <li class="volunteer-li">We do not use any volunteers in our kennels. Due to our high standards, we use professional staff only.</li>
                <li class="volunteer-li">ur student volunteer opportunities are limited, but we may occasionally require high school students looking to fulfill their community support hours. Students should complete the same application form, and we will contact them if an opportunity arises. It is suggested that students do not rely heavily on our organization for volunteer hours, and there will be nothing hands-on with dogs.</li>

                <p class="volunteer-detail"><span class="volunteer-detail-heading">PUPPY RAISING (OTTAWA, EASTERN ONTARIO) - </span>We place puppies into loving homes where there is a responsible adult, either home most of the day or with permission to take the dog to work for this commitment of 12-18 months.
                    If you are a tenant, you must provide written permission from the landlord/owner to have the dog on premises. A vehicle is required to attend training and vet appointments. Veterinary expenses are paid, and food is provided. The role is to
                    socialize the puppies and introduce them to as many different everyday environments as possible. Socialization begins in
                    the home, slowly advances to quiet residential areas, and gradually works up to other places including restaurants, shopping areas, public transit, and elevators. The program is supervised by staff of Canadian Guide Dogs for the Blind.
