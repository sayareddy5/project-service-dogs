                A volunteer is a person who believes that people can make a difference and is willing to prove it. Volunteers donâ€™t work for money. They work for less tangible but equally important forms of remuneration such as satisfaction, appreciation and the opportunity to build skills, all while helping others. Canadian Guide Dogs for the Blind relies greatly on volunteers to add to the success of our organization. If you are interested in volunteering for Canadian Guide Dogs for the Blind, please complete our volunteer application and submit it by email, mail, or drop it off at our National Training Centre.
